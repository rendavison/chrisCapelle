# About Me

<img src="assets/img/About_Me_Pic.jpeg" class="about-pic"/>

I’ve been working with Apple products for thirty years with clients of all types. My specialty is successfully solving technical problems for corporate, small office and home users.

In addition to performing hands-on tech support, I also teach adult ed classes and have published a series of how-to books, available at Amazon and Apple’s iBook Store.

Unlike many others in this field, I have the common sense as well as the personality to help all sorts of users with all sorts of issues.
